# Astro Status Webhooks Handler
This is a simple express server which listens for webhooks sent from [Astro's status page](https://astro-bot.space/status) and forwards them to Discord via Discord webhooks.

# Setup
If you want to receive Astro status notifications directly in your Discord server then follow the next steps:

## Setting up the Discord webhook
- Go in the channel where you want to receive status updates
- Open its settings
- Head over the `Integrations` tab
- Click on `Webhooks`
- Click `New webhook`
- Copy the `Webhook URL` with the apposite button  

## Setting up the config file
The Webhook URL copied from the last step should look something along this line:  
```
https://discord.com/api/webhooks/815309179048820776/dOWoDfsHwTFVVGNvwEp8wwbK0X0XTynxJnmzBrlXDWhd1GYWrcWye2WsRemGM669uCfB
```
- Now clone this repository either via git, or by clicking the green `Code` button on this page & `Download ZIP` & unzip it.

- In the folder you just downloaded rename the `examples.config.json` file to `config.json`.  

- Open that file and modify the `discord_webhook_id` value (which by default is `454487...`) with the ID of the Discord webhook that you created before (which in the example URL shown above is `815309179048820776` )

- Now modify the `discord_webhook_token` value by inserting the webhook token of the Discord URL that you created (which in the example above is `dOWoDfsHwTFVVGNvwEp8wwbK0X0XTynxJnmzBrlXDWhd1GYWrcWye2WsRemGM669uCfB` )  

## Subscribing to Astro's Status page with webhooks
You will need some sort of server to host this nodejs application.  
Once you got this app up and running head over to https://astro-bot.space/status, click `Get Updates` in the top-right, `Webhooks`, insert the application endpoint (for example `http://yourServerIP:8090/` where `8090` is the `server_port` value of the config.json file) and compile the rest of the form.  

## You're done ðŸŽ‰
